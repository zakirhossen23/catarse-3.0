        fund:
          title: Collective Financing or Crowdfunding?
          text: Two names for the same practice in which people contribute small sums
            of money to make projects viable. Crowd is crowd in English, funding,
            funding. Crowdfunding is funding by the crowd.
        allornothing:
          title: Why all or nothing?
          text_html: We believe in the &quot;all or nothing&quot; model because, in
            addition to the campaigns, it is one way of ensuring that a project will
            only happen if it can be delivered as it has been described and promised
            to the supporters.
        services:
          title: Our services
          text: Catarse provides support to site users and makes it possible for projects
            to capture resources quickly and easily using the internet. Anyone over
            the age of 18 (or younger, but with a legal representative) can use our
            services and run a crowdfunding campaign as long as the project meets
            our selection criteria.
        fees:
          title: How we stand
          text: We charge 13% of the total value of projects that have met or exceeded
            the collection goal. We get about 9% and 4% is passed on to Pay.me, payment
            method used in Catarse. Projects that did not reach the goal do not have
            any cost and all the supporters receive the money back.
