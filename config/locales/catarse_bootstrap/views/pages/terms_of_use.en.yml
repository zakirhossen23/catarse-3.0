        how_works: What is it and how does it work?
        how_works_text: CATARSE is an online platform that aims to bring together
          PROJECT CREATORS and SUPPORTERS, with the objective of COLLECTIVE COLLECTION
          OF FUNDS (&quot;crowd funding&quot;), to make feasible PROJECTS. CATARSE
          allows a PROJECT CREATOR to present a PROJECT idea and to raise funds from
          SUPPORTERS interested in contributing to this PROJECT. PROJECT CREATORS
          will also be able to offer SUPPORTERS rewards, which will be defined by
          the PROJECT CREATOR in each of these PROJECTS. CATARSE gathers the amounts
          disbursed by the SUPPORTERS destined to each of these PROJECTS until the
          final deadline determined by the respective CREATORS OF PROJECTS. <br> When
          a PROJECT EVERYTHING OR NOTHING reaches or exceeds the stipulated amount
          for its feasibility, within the term stipulated in the PROJECT, the total
          amount raised of the SUPPORTERS will be available to be redeemed by the
          PROJECT CREATOR, discounting the percentage due to CATARSE, provided that
          the amount collected exceeds the amount required by CATARSE as a minimum
          transfer. In contrast, if a PROJECT EVERYTHING OR NOTHING does not reach
          the requested amount, it will not be financed and CATARSE will provide the
          REIMBURSEMENT of the amounts paid. For amounts paid by credit card, REFUND
          will be made on the next invoice or subsequent invoice of the credit card.
          If the payment has been made through a bank slip, the REFUND will be made
          through deposit into the bank account indicated by the SUPPORTER, as requested
          by CATARSE. If the bank account is not provided for REIMBURSEMENT, CATARSE
          will keep the amounts available for REFUND for a maximum period of 90 days,
          as detailed in the item &quot;Fees and Payments&quot; below. <br>
        how_works_flex: What is and how does the Catarse Flex
        how_works_flex_text: In this modality, the objective of PROJECT CREATORS continues
          to be collective financing, but now with more flexibility. <br> Unlike CATARSE
          EVERYTHING or NOTHING, by choosing CATARSE FLEX the PROJECT CREATOR will
          be able to carry out longer lasting campaigns. To be created, the FLEX PROJECT
          does not need a closing date forecast. The campaign may be open for up to
          365 days from the date of publication of the PROJECT. <br> Unlike CATARSE
          ALL or NOTHING, the PROJECT CREATOR receives everything he has been able
          to collect until the moment the FLEX PROJECT is closed, provided that the
          amount collected exceeds the amount required by CATARSE as a minimum transfer.
          <br> In CATARSE FLEX, in addition, the SUPPORTER may receive rewards, provided
          that this possibility is clear in the FLEX PROJECT, but the SUPPORTER shall
          not receive, in any event, the amounts destined for that PROJECT, except
          in specific cases at CATARSE&#39;s discretion. <br>
        responsabilities: What are the responsibilities of creators and supporters?
        responsabilities_text: 'THE CREATOR OF PROJECTS: <br> 1. Choose the MODE of
          DESIGN you want to create, if DESIGN ALL or NOTHING or DESIGN FLEX; <br>

          who contribute to your PROJECT, determining the conditions of their obtaining,
          term and manner of receipt, as well as the number of SUPPORTERS that may
          benefit from these rewards. <br> 5.1. By establishing incentives and / or
          rewards in the PROJECT, it assumes the obligations set forth in article
          854 et seq. Of the Brazilian Civil Code, becoming directly responsible for
          fulfilling its promise to the SUPPORTERS that fulfill the stipulated conditions,
          without any direct or indirect liability , by CATARSE; <br> 6. You agree
          that the PROJECT presented may not be disclosed by CATARSE at its sole discretion;
          <br> 7. Assumes full and exclusive responsibility for taxes of any nature
          incident to the PROJECT or its activity, including taxes on payments related
          to its collection, expressly exempting CATARSE, according to the adjustment

          to their activity and / or collection; <br> 8. It undertakes to request
          the redemption of amounts collected through the platform within a maximum
          of 90 days from the closing date of the PROJECT, be it ALL or NOTHING, or
          FLEX. After this period, the values ​​in question will be considered irrevocably
          and irreversibly ceded to CATARSE and may be used by CATARSE in the manner
          CATARSE deems most convenient; <br> 9. In this act, it grants a specific
          mandate to CATARSE, which is hereby expressly authorized to manage the amounts
          of support and issue, on behalf of the PROJECT CREATOR, a receipt to the
          SUPPORTER, indicating the project supported, the date of payment, the value
          mail address, e-mail, address, full name or corporate name, CPF or CNPJ

          himself for the selected PROJECT; <br> 4. Make the payment by means of credit
          card or bank slip. <br> 4.1 When choosing payments through a bank slip,
          if the ticket generated is not paid on the due date stipulated therein,
          the support will not be effective and therefore will not entitle the SUPPORTER
          to the reward eventually defined in the PROJECT; <br> 4.2 When performing
          the support by credit card, your act will be considered irreversible and
          irrevocable, the SUPPORTER being responsible for any damages caused to CATARSE
          or third parties for the non-recognition of the operation with the credit
          card operator; <br> 4.3. Upon fulfilling the stipulated conditions for receiving
          the incentives and / or rewards promised by the PROJECT CREATOR, the SUPPORTER
          acquires the rights provided for in article 855 et seq. Of the Brazilian
          Civil Code, and shall require directly from the PROJECT CREATOR, depending
          on the case, the fulfillment of its promise, being aware that there is no
          direct or indirect responsibility on the part of CATARSE in this regard;
          <br> 4.3. When deciding to support a given project, allocating resources
          to it, the SUPPORTER assumes the responsibility of keeping an up-to-date
          register and indicating a bank account for eventual REFUND if he / she decides
          to grant support per boleto bancário; <br> 4.4. By supporting a project,
          the SUPPORTER grants a specific mandate to CATARSE, which is expressly authorized
          to manage the values ​​of the supports during the entire period in which
          the PROJECTS remain open and until watering by the PROJECT CREATOR, REFUNDS
          to SUPPORTERS or the assignment of credit for the amounts by the PROJECT
          CREATOR or by the SUPPORTERS to CATARSE that do not keep their data updated
          for the delivery of the amounts by CATARSE is set up; <br> 5. It is solely
          responsible for monitoring the development of the PROJECT, through information
          provided directly by the PROJECT CREATOR and, in the alternative, CATARSE,
          being aware and agree that CATARSE has no obligation to monitor the PROJECT
          and also no responsibility , directly or indirectly, on the information
          provided by the PROJECT CREATOR, whether in relation to the veracity and

          incentives and / or rewards or in relation to any other related data type
          to the PROJECT and its development. CATARSE shall use its best efforts to
          keep the SUPPORTER informed of the success or failure of the PROJECT it
          supports, but this effort does not represent any responsibility on the part
          of CATARSE, with which the SUPPORTER expressly agrees; <br> 6. You can send

        tax: Fees and payments
        tax_text: 'The SUPPORTER and the CREATOR of the PROJECT are fully aware and
          agree that all amounts destined to the support of projects can only be collected
          by means of a credit card or bank slip, (according to the option of the
          SUPPORTER), being deposited in an account owned by CATARSE . <br/> In the
          case of support through CATARSE FLEX, once the PROJECT has been closed by
          the PROJECT CREATOR, the total amount collected for this PROJECT will be
          available to be redeemed by the CREATOR of the PROJECT for 90 days counted
          from the closing date of the PROJECT, discounting the amount of 13% (thirteen
          percent) related to the CATARSE intermediation rate and the fees charged
          by the means of payment. In the period in which the amounts collected remain
          under the management of CATARSE, eventual income from financial investments
          may be included in the amount collected and form the basis upon which the
          above mentioned rate will be assigned at the time of the redemption. It
          is reiterated that, there will be no possibility of returning to the SUPPORTERS
          the values ​​destined to FLEX PROJECTS. The date of release of the amounts
          collected may vary according to the form and the means with which the supports
          have been made. <br/> In the case of support for PROJECT EVERYTHING or NOTHING,
          once the support materialized, two possibilities arise: <br/> If the PROJECT
          IS FINANCED, the total amount collected for this PROJECT (even if greater
          than the amount originally requested by the PROJECT CREATOR) will be available
          to be redeemed by the PROJECT CREATOR for 90 days counted from the closing
          date of the PROJECT, if the amount of 13% (thirteen percent) refers to the
          CATARSE intermediation rate and to the rates charged by the means of payment.
          In the period in which the amounts collected remain under the management
          of CATARSE, eventual income from financial investments may be included in
          the amount collected and form the basis upon which the above mentioned rate
          will be assigned at the time of the redemption. The date of release of the
          amounts collected may vary according to the form and the means with which
          the supports have been made. <br/> If the PROJECT IS NOT FINANCED, the SUPPORTERS
          that have made the SUPPORT through credit card, will automatically receive
          the REIMBURSEMENT of the amount originally offered to the PROJECT, the next
          invoice or the invoice subsequent to the closing date of the PROJECT. The
          SUPPORTERS who have made the SUPPORT through bank transfer, will be informed
          by CATARSE that the PROJECT has not been financed and must provide the data
          of their bank account so that the REIMBURSEMENT can be realized. CATARSE
          emphasizes that in this case the REFUND can not be done automatically, considering
          that at the moment of the SUPPORT does not require bank details of the SUPPORTERS
          that pay via bank wire. <br> The SUPPORTER is aware that if he does not
          provide his bank details when informed by CATARSE that the supported PROJECT
          has not been FINANCED, it will not be possible for CATARSE to perform the
          REFUND. In this case, by mere liberality, CATARSE will keep the amounts
          available for redemption for 90 days from the date of termination of the
          PROJECT. After this period, an assignment of the irrevocable and irreversible
          credit of the SUPPORTER to CATARSE shall be considered effected, which is
          expressly authorized by the SUPPORTER to give the destination that best
          suits the values ​​held on the platform, at which point the SUPPORTER you
          will lose the ability to claim such amounts in any way and at any time.
          <br> Unless stated otherwise, all fees are quoted in Reais (R $). The USER
          is responsible for paying all fees and taxes associated with the use of
          CATARSE, including, but not limited to, the CATARSE intermediation fee and
          rates or fees charged by the means of payment, as well as any taxes or duties
          or to focus on the PROJECT or on the approximation between the SUPPORTER
          and the PROJECT CREATOR. If a PROJECT is withdrawn from the CATARSE for
          violation of the Terms of Use, violation of legal norms or by court order,
          the amounts paid by the SUPPORTERS may not be reimbursed, in case the SUPPORTER,
          aware of such violation, has not reported it to CATARSE through do contato@catarse.me.
          <br> Since the banking and credit card services are independent of CATARSE,
          they have exclusive responsibility for the payments processed and are responsible
          for the failure to use their means of payment. <br>'
        chargeback: Dispute of Payments
        chargeback_text: CATARSE is not responsible for any disputes about payment
          or cancellation of support. Thus, whenever support is frustrated for any
          reason, either for reasons attributed to the PROJECT CREATOR, SUPPORTERS
          or to third parties, CATARSE is authorized to deduct, at any time, from
          the balance of the PROJECT CREATOR the amounts referring to transactions
          that are blocked, canceled or disputed in any way. In the event that there
          is not enough PROJECT CREATOR balance to cover the amount of the frustrated
          support, the PROJECT CREATOR will be responsible for providing the reimbursement
          of the value for CATARSE. <br>
        rights: Intellectual Property Rights
        rights_text: CATARSE is the owner of the intellectual property rights related
          to its own service, which are protected by Brazilian laws and international

          copyright law (Law No. 9.610 / 98) and industrial property law (Law No.
          9.279 / 96). <br/> However, PROJECT CREATORS are aware that by using CATARSE,
          they are trying to raise funds for their PROJECT publicly and thereby take
          the risk that their idea will be copied and developed by third parties.

          that a dispute has been established whose decision is beyond the prerogatives
          of CATARSE, and that the removal of the content will only be effected through
          order. <br> Notifying the platform regarding a violation of rights is a
          serious matter with legal consequences. In case of doubt about the infraction,
